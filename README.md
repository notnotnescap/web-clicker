# Web Clicker

This is a simple python web server designed to run on a laptop running a presentation. It serves a single web page that has next and previous buttons that send keyboard events the laptop.

This project was created to solve signal range issues with standard presentation remotes. By using a web page, any device on the same network can control the presentation.
